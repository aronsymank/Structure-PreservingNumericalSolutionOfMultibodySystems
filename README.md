# MasterThesis_Structure-PreservingNumericalSolutionOfMultibodySystems
My master thesis in Scientific Computing at Technical University Berlin. I investigated and implemented several numerical solvers for constrained multibody systems with a focus on conservation of energy / power balance and constraints.
